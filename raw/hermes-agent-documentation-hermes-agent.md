The self-improving AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com/). The only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions.

## Install

**Linux / macOS / WSL2**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (native, PowerShell)** — *early beta, [details →](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/windows-native)*

```powershell
iex (irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.ps1)
```

**Android (Termux)** — same curl one-liner as Linux; the installer auto-detects Termux.

See the full **[Installation Guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/installation)** for what the installer does, the per-user vs root layout, and Windows-specific notes.

## What is Hermes Agent?

It's not a coding copilot tethered to an IDE or a chatbot wrapper around a single API. It's an **autonomous agent** that gets more capable the longer it runs. It lives wherever you put it — a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure (Daytona, Modal) that costs nearly nothing when idle. Talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM you never SSH into yourself. It's not tied to your laptop.

## Key Features

- **A closed learning loop** — Agent-curated memory with periodic nudges, autonomous skill creation, skill self-improvement during use, FTS5 cross-session recall with LLM summarization, and [Honcho](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho) dialectic user modeling
- **Runs anywhere, not just your laptop** — 6 terminal backends: local, Docker, SSH, Daytona, Singularity, Modal. Daytona and Modal offer serverless persistence — your environment hibernates when idle, costing nearly nothing
- **Lives where you do** — CLI, Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Matrix, Mattermost, Email, SMS, DingTalk, Feishu, WeCom, Weixin, QQ Bot, Yuanbao, BlueBubbles, Home Assistant, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, and more — 20+ platforms from one gateway
- **Built by model trainers** — Created by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com/), the lab behind Hermes, Nomos, and Psyche. Works with [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com/), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), OpenAI, or any endpoint
- **Scheduled automations** — Built-in cron with delivery to any platform
- **Delegates & parallelizes** — Spawn isolated subagents for parallel workstreams. Programmatic Tool Calling via `execute_code` collapses multi-step pipelines into single inference calls
- **Open standard skills** — Compatible with [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/). Skills are portable, shareable, and community-contributed via the Skills Hub
- **Full web control** — Search, extract, browse, vision, image generation, TTS
- **MCP support** — Connect to any MCP server for extended tool capabilities
- **Research-ready** — Batch processing, trajectory export, RL training with Atropos. Built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com/) — the lab behind Hermes, Nomos, and Psyche models
